# **Goals and Background Context**

**Goals**
*   Onboard 50 employers and 1,000 active job seekers within the first 6 months.
*   Facilitate 500 successful job applications through the platform within the first quarter.
*   Reduce the time it takes for a job seeker to find and apply for 5 relevant jobs.
*   Increase the application-to-interview ratio for employers using the platform.

**Background Context**

The current job search landscape is fragmented and inefficient for both job seekers and employers. Job seekers struggle to find relevant opportunities and track applications across multiple sites, while employers find existing platforms complex and ineffective for sourcing quality candidates. Recruitify aims to solve this by providing a streamlined, all-in-one web platform that simplifies the job search and application management process for both parties.
