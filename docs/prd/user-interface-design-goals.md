# **User Interface Design Goals**

**Overall UX Vision**
The user experience should be clean, modern, and intuitive, aiming to minimize friction for both job seekers and employers. The design will prioritize clarity, efficiency, and trustworthiness, ensuring users can accomplish their primary tasks with ease. The interface will feel professional and straightforward, avoiding unnecessary complexity.

**Key Interaction Paradigms**
*   **Search-centric:** A prominent search bar will be the primary entry point for job seekers.
*   **Dashboard Model:** Employers will manage all their activities (job posts, applicants) from a central dashboard.
*   **List-based Management:** Job results, saved jobs, application history, and applicant lists will be presented in clear, filterable, and sortable lists.
*   **Guided Forms:** User registration, profile creation, and job posting will be handled through simple, clearly defined forms.

**Core Screens and Views**
*   Home/Landing Page
*   Job Search Results Page
*   Job Details Page
*   Login / Registration Page
*   Job Seeker Profile & Application History Page
*   Employer Dashboard & Job Management Page
*   "Create/Edit Job Post" Page
*   "View Applicants" Page

**Accessibility: WCAG AA**

**Branding**
No specific branding guidelines have been provided for the MVP. The initial design will use a clean, neutral color palette and a professional look and feel that can be easily adapted to a formal style guide post-launch.

**Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive**
