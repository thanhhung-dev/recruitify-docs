# Proposed Solution

We propose to build a modern web application, "Recruitify," with a focus on speed, simplicity, and user experience. The solution will consist of a Next.js frontend using Ant Design for a clean and responsive UI, and a robust backend powered by Spring Boot and a PostgreSQL database. The core concept is to provide a highly focused set of features for the MVP that perfects the core experience of job searching, applying, and management, with a plan for intelligent features post-MVP.
