# Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks
- **Scope Creep:** The temptation to add more features to the MVP could risk the 3-4 month timeline. Mitigation: Strict adherence to the defined MVP scope.
- **Competition:** The job search market is crowded. Mitigation: Focus on superior user experience and a niche (tech sector) to gain an initial foothold.

### Open Questions
- What is the long-term monetization strategy?
- How will the platform be marketed to attract an initial user base of job seekers and recruiters?
