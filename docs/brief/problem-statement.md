# Problem Statement

For job seekers, the current landscape of job boards is often cluttered, with slow interfaces and cumbersome application processes. It can be difficult to track application statuses and receive timely feedback. For recruiters, posting jobs and managing candidates can be equally inefficient, making it challenging to find qualified candidates quickly. Existing solutions often lack a modern technology stack, leading to a subpar user experience.
