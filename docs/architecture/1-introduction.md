# 1. Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for Recruitify, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

> **Starter Template or Existing Project**
> 
> This is a greenfield project. While we are not using a pre-packaged starter template (like T3 Stack or a MERN starter), the PRD has already specified the core technologies: a **Next.js** frontend and a **Spring Boot** backend, organized in a monorepo. Our architecture will be built from the ground up based on these foundational choices.
