# Recruitify Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## **Goals and Background Context**

**Goals**
*   Onboard 50 employers and 1,000 active job seekers within the first 6 months.
*   Facilitate 500 successful job applications through the platform within the first quarter.
*   Reduce the time it takes for a job seeker to find and apply for 5 relevant jobs.
*   Increase the application-to-interview ratio for employers using the platform.

**Background Context**

The current job search landscape is fragmented and inefficient for both job seekers and employers. Job seekers struggle to find relevant opportunities and track applications across multiple sites, while employers find existing platforms complex and ineffective for sourcing quality candidates. Recruitify aims to solve this by providing a streamlined, all-in-one web platform that simplifies the job search and application management process for both parties.

## **User Interface Design Goals**

**Overall UX Vision**
The user experience should be clean, modern, and intuitive, aiming to minimize friction for both job seekers and employers. The design will prioritize clarity, efficiency, and trustworthiness, ensuring users can accomplish their primary tasks with ease. The interface will feel professional and straightforward, avoiding unnecessary complexity.

**Key Interaction Paradigms**
*   **Search-centric:** A prominent search bar will be the primary entry point for job seekers.
*   **Dashboard Model:** Employers will manage all their activities (job posts, applicants) from a central dashboard.
*   **List-based Management:** Job results, saved jobs, application history, and applicant lists will be presented in clear, filterable, and sortable lists.
*   **Guided Forms:** User registration, profile creation, and job posting will be handled through simple, clearly defined forms.

**Core Screens and Views**
*   Home/Landing Page
*   Job Search Results Page
*   Job Details Page
*   Login / Registration Page
*   Job Seeker Profile & Application History Page
*   Employer Dashboard & Job Management Page
*   "Create/Edit Job Post" Page
*   "View Applicants" Page

**Accessibility: WCAG AA**

**Branding**
No specific branding guidelines have been provided for the MVP. The initial design will use a clean, neutral color palette and a professional look and feel that can be easily adapted to a formal style guide post-launch.

**Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive**

---

## **Technical Assumptions**

**Repository Structure: Monorepo**
A monorepo will be used to manage both the frontend (Next.js) and backend (Spring Boot) code in a single repository.

**Service Architecture: Monolith**
For the MVP, a monolithic service architecture will be implemented. This approach is suitable for the initial feature set and allows for rapid development. The architecture should still be designed with modularity in mind to allow for potential future migration to microservices.

**Testing Requirements: Unit & Integration Testing**
All critical business logic in both the frontend and backend must be covered by unit tests. Integration tests should be written for key user workflows, such as user registration and application submission, to ensure the components work together correctly.

**Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests**
*   **Frontend:** Next.js with Ant Design for the component library.
*   **Backend:** Spring Boot (Java) to build the RESTful API.
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL will be the relational database.

---

## **Epic List**

*   **Epic 1: Foundation & Core Job Seeker Experience.**
    *   **Goal:** Establish the foundational infrastructure of the application and deliver the core job search experience for the primary user (Job Seeker). This includes project setup, user registration/login, and the ability to search, view, and save jobs.
*   **Epic 2: Employer Functionality & Application Workflow.**
    *   **Goal:** Introduce the employer side of the platform and connect the two user types. This epic enables employers to post and manage jobs, and allows job seekers to submit applications.
*   **Erpic 3: Dashboad & History.**
    *   **Goal:** Enhance the user experience by providing tools for management and tracking. This includes the job seeker's application history and the employer's dashboard for managing applicants.
