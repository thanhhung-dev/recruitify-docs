# **Accessibility Requirements**

**Compliance Target**

- **Standard:** Our goal is to meet **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA**.

**Key Requirements**

- **Visual:** All text must have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1. All interactive elements must have a clear, visible focus outline.
- **Interaction:** All functionality must be accessible using only the keyboard. Touch targets will be a minimum of 44x44 pixels.
- **Content:** All images that convey information must have descriptive `alt` text. A logical heading structure will be used. All form inputs will have associated labels.

**Testing Strategy**
We will use a combination of automated testing (`axe-core`) and manual testing (keyboard-only, screen readers).
